# Frequent-Pattern-Mining-Algorithms

a) Write  colabs to demonstrate frequent pattern mining apriori and fpgrowth techniques

Apriori Algo:

Details of the dataset
The dataset has 38765 rows of the purchase orders of people from the grocery stores. These orders can be analysed using Market Basket Analysis by Apriori Algorithm.

b) Write colab to demonstrate frequent pattern mining technique using databricks platform (refer to slides for hints - m arket basket analysis example)

I used the Apriori algorithm and FP growth to perform market basket analysis in this databricks notebook. Data are combined after being collected from various sources. The datset is then given the necessary transforms. To comprehend and visualize the data, EDA is applied to the dataset. For developing the association rules, I have worked with Python and the Apriori method. In order to build association rules using the apriori algorithm, a basket is created containing the 100 most often ordered goods. The best association rules are therefore obtained. I've tried using SQL and Scala to create top association rules using the FP growth algorithm.
